The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
A <header> element typically contains:
    - one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
    - logo or icon
    - authorship information
Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.

The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section.
A <footer> element typically contains:
    - authorship information
    - copyright information
    - contact information
    - sitemap
    - back to top links
    - related documents
You can have several <footer> elements in one document.

The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
Potential sources for the <article> element:
    - Forum post
    - Blog post
    - News story
Note: The <article> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <article> element (see example below).

The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.
The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
Tip: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
Note: The <aside> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <aside> element (see example below).
